Task 5 – Malware Types & Behavior Analysis (Basic)
Introduction:
Malware (Malicious Software) refers to programs designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. This report provides a basic analysis of common malware types, their behavior,
lifecycle, and prevention methods. The goal of this task is to build foundational awareness of how malware operates and how it can be mitigated.
Malware Type 1: Ransomware
Description:
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim’s files and demands a ransom payment, usually in cryptocurrency, to restore access.
Behavior Analysis:
Encrypts user files and system data
Displays a ransom message on the infected system
Prevents access to important files and services
Spread Methods:
Phishing emails with malicious attachments
Exploiting unpatched system vulnerabilities
Malicious downloads from untrusted websites
Impact:
Data loss or unavailability
Financial damage
Operational disruption

Malware Type 2: Trojan
Description:
A Trojan disguises itself as legitimate software to trick users into installing it. Once executed, it performs malicious activities in the background.
Behavior Analysis:
Steals sensitive information (passwords, banking data)
Opens backdoors for attackers
Downloads additional malware
Spread Methods:
Fake software installers
Email attachments
Cracked or pirated software
Impact:
Data theft
System compromise
Privacy violation
Malware Lifecycle
Most malware follows a common lifecycle:
Infection – Malware enters the system through email, download, or exploit
Execution – Malicious code runs on the system
Persistence – Malware ensures it remains active after reboot
Propagation – Spreads to other systems (in some cases)
Damage – Data theft, encryption, or system disruption
Removal – Detection and elimination using security tools
Prevention Techniques:
Install and update antivirus software
Keep operating systems and applications updated
Avoid clicking suspicious links or email attachments
Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication
Maintain regular data backups
Enable firewalls and endpoint protection
Tools Referenced:
VirusTotal – Used for malware hash lookup and reputation analysis (theoretical reference)
Any.Run – Online malware analysis sandbox (theoretical reference)
Note: Due to access restrictions on public networks, tools were referenced for understanding malware behavior rather than live analysis.
Conclusion:
This task provided an overview of common malware types, their behavior, lifecycle, and prevention methods. Understanding how malware operates is essential for building strong cybersecurity practices and 
defending systems against modern threats.
