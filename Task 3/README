Task 3: Networking Basics for Cybersecurity
Objective:
The goal here was to get a grip on basic networking stuff and dive into real live network traffic using packet capture tools. 
It really shows how data moves around networks and how protocols work in actual use cases, which is super useful for cybersecurity.
Environment:
OS: Kali Linux (dual boot on bare metal)
Network: Wi-Fi or USB tethering
Tool: Wireshark
Tool Description:
Wireshark is this awesome network protocol analyzer that lets you capture and dig into packets live.
It's a go-to for security folks to check out network behavior, spot weird stuff, and break down how protocols talk to each other
Activities Performed
Got Kali connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or USB tethering.
Fired up Wireshark as root.
Picked the active interface (wlan0).
Started capturing traffic while I browsed some sites.
Threw on some protocol filters to narrow it down.
Watched a TCP connection get set up.
Checked out both encrypted and non-encrypted traffic.
Saved the capture file for later.
Filters Used:
Purpose	Wireshark Filter
DNS traffic	dns
TCP traffic	tcp
HTTPS traffic	https
TLS encrypted traffic	tls
TCP three-way handshake	tcp.flags.syn == 1
QUIC protocol	quic
Observations:
DNS Traffic
I saw DNS queries and responses popping up. Domains got resolved to IPs, which makes sense—it's the first step before anything else happens.
TCP Traffic:
Tons of TCP packets for reliable data sending. Source/dest ports were clear, and it handles ordering and errors like a champ.
TCP Three-Way Handshake:
Filtered with tcp.flags.syn == 1 and caught the whole thing:
SYN from client
SYN-ACK from server
ACK from client
Pretty cool to see TCP connections happen live.
Encrypted Traffic (HTTPS/TLS):
Lots of TLSv1.x stuff. The "Application Data" was all encrypted—couldn't read a thing, which is exactly what you want for security.
QUIC Protocol:
Spotted QUIC too, which runs on UDP. Modern browsers love it for speed and security.
Security Analysis:
Plain-text traffic is a no-go—it leaks sensitive info. But HTTPS and TLS keep things locked down. 
Analyzing packets like this helps you spot weak spots and threats. Knowing protocols inside out is key for defending networks.
Conclusion:
Hands-on with Wireshark was eye-opening. I captured and picked apart DNS, TCP, TLS, QUIC, and more. It really drove home how secure vs. insecure traffic works, and that's core for cybersecurity skills.
