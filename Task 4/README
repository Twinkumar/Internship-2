The goal of this task is to understand password hashing, generate different types of hashes, and attempt to crack them using John the Ripper with a wordlist. 
This task demonstrates how weak passwords can be recovered and why strong hashing algorithms matter.
Operating System: Kali Linux (Bare Metal / Dual Boot)
Tools Used:
   `md5sum`, `sha1sum`
   `htpasswd`
   `john` (John the Ripper)
   `rockyou.txt` wordlist
```bash
echo -n "password123" | md5sum

```bash
echo -n "password123" | sha1sum

```bash
htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" password123 | tr -d ':\n'

A hash file was created containing one hash per line.

```bash
echo "482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38" > hashes.txt

The file was verified using:

```bash
wc -l hashes.txt
This ensured that the file contained exactly one hash and no empty lines.

The default Kali wordlist `rockyou.txt.gz` was extracted:

```bash
sudo gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz

```bash
john --format=raw-md5 hashes.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```bash
john --show --format=raw-md5 hashes.txt

Weak hashes (MD5, SHA-1) were cracked successfully using the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.
Stronger hashes (bcrypt) were not cracked, demonstrating better security.
Hashing is a one-way process; passwords are not encrypted.
Weak hashing algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1 are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
Proper file formatting (one hash per line) is critical for tools like John.
Strong hashing algorithms such as bcrypt significantly improve password security.
Conclusion:
This task provided hands-on experience with password hashing and cracking techniques using Kali Linux. It highlights the importance of strong passwords and secure hashing algorithms in real-world systems.
